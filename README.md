This is SnowWolf. A programming project with graphics on Linux.

To get SDL working I needed to install libsdl2-dev and libsdl2-dbg.

Switched from SDL to GLFW for graphics. To get started I followed GLFW doc and

Added GLEW to be able to use all versions of OpenGL. Basically followed the instructions from GLEW homepage
